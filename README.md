# David Inga's dotfiles

I maintain this repo as my dotfiles.

## Installation

First, install the Command Line Tools:

    xcode-select --install

and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Then we can install brew dependencies:

    ./brew.sh

We are using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

## Usage

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in ~/Projects/dotfiles, with ~/dotfiles as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

    git clone https://github.com/davidsingal/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source install.sh

To update, cd into your local dotfiles repository and then:

    source install.sh

### Add files

Add this to `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Load the shell dotfiles, and then some:
# * ~/.extra can be used for other settings you donâ€™t want to commit.
for file in ~/.{exports,aliases,extra}; do
  [ -r "$file" ] && [ -f "$file" ] && source "$file";
done;
unset file;
```

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Your name"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="user@example.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```
